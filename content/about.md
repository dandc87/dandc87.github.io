Hi.

I've been an Android developer since 2011,
and I've worked on all sorts of Android related projects.

I've been the solo Android Engineer,
and I've love building compelling UI/UX that will delight users.

I've also been a Senior Engineer,
who can mentor juniors, and lead with technical expertise.

And when I get the chance, I love working on tooling and metaprogramming projects :)

Less professionally, I love living in Minnesota!

There's a lot of great outdoor activites,
and in the winter I enjoy going to the local curling club.
